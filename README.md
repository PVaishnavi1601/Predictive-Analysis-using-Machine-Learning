Task Description:
For the second task of my internship, I focused on a regression problem where the objective was to predict house prices using the California Housing dataset. Before beginning the implementation, I studied the dataset carefully to understand its structure and the significance of different features such as median income, house age, average number of rooms, average occupancy, and geographical coordinates. This dataset was particularly useful because it contains real-world housing data, making the problem practical and relevant. By analyzing the dataset beforehand, I was able to plan feature selection and preprocessing steps more effectively.

To build and train the predictive models, I relied on multiple resources to strengthen my understanding. I referred to GeeksforGeeks (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) to study regression concepts, evaluation metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R², and preprocessing techniques such as feature scaling. I used quickref.me (https://quickref.me/) as a quick reference for Scikit-learn syntax, which saved me a lot of time during coding and helped avoid common errors. Additionally, I explored online articles and tutorials, including the official Scikit-learn documentation (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and blogs from Towards Data Science (https://towardsdatascience.com/) and Google search results, to compare Linear Regression with Random Forest Regression.

From my research and implementation, I learned that Linear Regression is a simple and interpretable model suitable for data with linear relationships, but it struggles when patterns are non-linear or when multicollinearity is present. On the other hand, Random Forest, being an ensemble method, combines the predictions of multiple decision trees to capture complex relationships, making it more robust and accurate. After evaluation, Random Forest showed higher R² values and lower error metrics compared to Linear Regression, proving its superiority in this dataset.

This task not only enhanced my technical skills in data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation but also gave me practical experience in comparing models, understanding bias-variance trade-offs, and interpreting results. I also gained insights into important machine learning concepts such as ensemble learning, feature importance, and the role of scaling in regression models. Overall, this task helped me develop a more well-rounded perspective on predictive analysis and its applications in real-world data science projects.
